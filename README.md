<h1>Cellular Sandbox</h1>
<h4>Project Started: 15/02/2024</h4>

Cellular Sandbox is a game/sandbox in which you can place particles that interact and have different properties. It is a simple implementation
as there are far more advanced versions around, but as my first personal project it served as a great way to build familiarity and understanding
in Java, which has been my primary language at Swansea University.

Within the sandbox you can manipulate particles such as: *Water*, *Sand*, *Rock*, *Wood*, *Fire*, *Lava*, and more. The main aim was to focus on
the rules of individual particles, however they branched in complexity and the use of abstract Particles along with some use of Interfaces was used to
contain and reduce repeated code.

<h3> Motivation </h3>

Inspired by the **Powder Game** by Dan Ball (https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust/) which I enjoyed for hours in my childhood.
Off the back of a university project that used JavaFX, I wanted to create something I would find fun but not too challenging.
Cellular Automata stood out to me as a fun way to create something visual, thus I created this Cellular Sandbox.

<h3> What I learned </h3>
A better understanding of grid based games, how to utilise a 1D array as a grid, and also how to optimise rendering slightly, where the program will not
update the render if no particle is moved. This could be enhanced if different parts of the grid were optimised in chunks, allowing more of the grid to not be rendered
but that hasn't been done yet here.

  <h4>The skills I learned:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Cellular Automata</li>
    <li> Furthering Java skills</li>
    <li> JavaFX</li>
    <li> CSS for sandbox UI</li>
    <li> Project Development</li>
  </ul>

<h3> What would I do better </h3>

If I were to do this project again I would use version control to keep track of development and allow fallbacks
when errors occur that I cannot revert from. This came up a few times during development and since this project I have continued
to use **Git** to develop further projects.

I would also start very simple with implementation, at first I rushed into details like trying to have velocity and density,
while in reality I should have got the basics in and built out from there.

<h3> What next for the Cellular Sandbox? </h3>
Although it could be unlikely I return to this project, it was entertaining and extremely useful for learning project
development. Some features I would still hope to achieve are: <br></br>

<ul>
  <li> More particle types</li>
  <li> An improved velocity system</li>
  <li> Smoother drawing tools</li>
  <li> More interactions between particle types</li>
  <li> Specifically a 'plant' particle which grows with certain conditions</li>
  <li> Remake the UI</li>
  <li> Wind simulation</li>
  <li> Explosion simulations</li>
</ul>
