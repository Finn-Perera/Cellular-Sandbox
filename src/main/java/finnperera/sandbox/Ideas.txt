Things to focus on:
- Implementing new elements
- Implementing velocity/acceleration
- Developing a UI   DONE

Areas to change:
- Maybe I should make the update within the particle itself
- Should gravity take in 1 particle, get its velocity and then call swap
  based on a calculation of how many pixels it will use (if falling at 2, check 2 places ahead for empty
  if not get the ones before that.)
- Varying colours? Could I add a randomish modifier to the creation of objects' colours
- Add gasses/liquids/solids?
